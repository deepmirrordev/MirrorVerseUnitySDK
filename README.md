# MirrorVerse Unity SDK

Welcome to the MirrorVerse Developer Platform. Here we provide this SDK for developer to make their AR apps and AR games blended with virtual and physical reality in a realistic and sharing experieance.

## MirrorScene API

The `MirrorScene` API is part of MirrorVerse SDK, providing AR functionality that is suiltable for any small scale scenes, like rooms, table tops or offices. With MirrorScene API and MirrorScene UI components, developers can easily create a shared scene with one or more users in real time, make virtual worlds in games or apps interact with surrounding physical objects, and create great AR expereinces that are only limited by imaginations.


*Reality Guard: AR Tower Siege*, a mobile AR game which uses this MirrorScene API can give you a taste. Please check it out:
